Who needs headphones or what to make announcements. You\\'re tired of being scolded by the French in Call of Duty. You like to put more money in a game than necessary. You like it when you buy expensive weapons skins which are later less worth. You love to play a game for all eternity, But still not reach a new level as in other games. You like to be scolded as a noob because you have 2 kills less than the one who insults you. If you play a different weapon than all the others you are badly made. Your love for Eastern countries increases thereby you will harder. If you play alone then you meet strangers who can not speak your language or English.

You can find everything you need to know about shakes and fidget from us. All new features, opponents, dungeons and more ... The most important things to get started with Shakes and Fidget is all about gold, experience and other players knocking. You started to show everyone. No matter whether alone or with the help of your guild. How do you get gold and experience? Swing yourselves into the \\ 'tavern \\' and do adventures that are offered there. This gives you a lot of these things to develop your character and become stronger. If you run out of aluminum, you can buy up to 220 aluminum from the innkeeper for mushrooms. Initially only 200 until you are level 66 and gain access to the witch. Scrapbook: Scrapbook From level 10collects hundreds of items and improves your experience in adventures in the tavern. The dungeons: the dungeons from level 10, finish one dungeon after the other and show the monsters where the club hangs ^^ There are also delicious epic equipment items and a lot of experience points. The dungeon keys: the dungeon keys from level 10 in order to enter dungeons you need a dungeon key that opens them. You can find them now and then in the adventures of the tavern or the magic shop. How do you get gold and experience faster? The easiest way is with a mount from the stable. It’s best to grab the most expensive creature right away. The 25 mushrooms are well invested. The smaller mounts make no sense and there are more than enough mushrooms. You don't have to buy them from Shakes and Fidget :-) The mirror: The mirror from level 50 Collect all mirror parts to complete your mirror. This allows you to beat other players or enter a dungeon during an adventure. The Witch: The Witch from level 66 The witch enables you to enchant your weapons and armor items to further strengthen your character. The Tower: The Tower After 9 Dungeons As soon as you have finished all dungeons you are allowed to enter the tower. There you will find more opponents and the demon portal. In addition, three helpers will be made available to you for the battle in the tower. How do you get more experience and gold? You can also beat up other players in the \\ 'arena \\', but beware, these are usually a lot stronger than you. To avoid this, just trot over to the \\ 'Ehrenhalle \\' and look for easier victims. The toilet: the toilet from level 100 Everything you wash down the toilet here turns into objects that you can put on your three companions in the tower. When the pot is full, a rinse creates more epic items. Demon portal (dungeon): Demon portal (dungeon) after 9 dungeons Here you have to slaughter more demons :-) But they recover by 10% every day and represent a real challenge for every shakes and fidget gamers. Demon portal (guild): Demon portal (guild ) From level 99 here you fight with your guild members against powerful monsters. These recover by 10% every day. Every member is allowed to thrash this opponent once a day. Meeeeehr Gold Yes, yes, that's fine ... ^^ There is another way to get the delicious gold taler. If you have used up your \\ 'ALU \\' (thirst for adventure) in the tavern and are tired of thrashing others, just go to \\ 'Stadtwache \\'. You can get gold for doing nothing for up to 10 hours. However, you cannot do anything else then. Bugs? Sound? Graphic? Unfortunately there is a small bug in the appearance that your HP will fall or rise continuously (not fight relevant), I like the sounds very much, as well as the graphics because this game was brought from the browser to Steam.

Recommend.\"\ntest['user_review'][7513] = \"Early Access Review Well guys, here's the thing, I've been playing this game here since the time when it had no division, that is, when just survive and king of the kill were the same game. At that time, the game was extremely poorly optimized. I have a pc with an i5 3330 processor, a gtx 750 ti video card and 8gb of ram and with these configurations the game should run on ultra with a good slack, but that was not what happened. Not even in the low, with the textures and graphic qualities, he ran right. This game had constant drops of FPS. Most of the time, running at 100 fps, it dropped quickly to 20, 15, and that was straightforward, almost every minute of the game, making it impossible to play. Now in the division, the game was a little more optimized, but almost nothing at all. FPS drops are still very constant, regardless of the graphics quality that is left. In my view, it is still unplayable. I hope that someday, daybreak will decide to optimize this game for all users to be able to enjoy an acceptable graphic quality to play, especially those who have a pc with the recommended requirements to play in the largest possible graphic and that unfortunately cannot, due to the team's poor commitment to bringing a well-optimized game. Below is the first analysis I made of the game, positively, when I was eager to play it. After a few hours of playing, I came to do another analysis, negating. And now I'm doing the final analysis, but I won't take the first one I did, follow below if you want to see the first analysis I made of the game, a very good analysis Hue Hue BR:> Full 2015> Living in the northeast> Internet of 1 mega that only 500 kb> Bolado.jpeg> Buy the game in the Christmas promotion for 24 bucks> Still sad because it will take a century to download> Boot to download the game> 4.7gb game> Lowering to 40kb ~ 50kb> Estimated 3 days to complete the game> VERY TRISTE.exe> ​​2 days downloading> 3 days downloading> Few hours to finish the download> VERY HAPPY.rar> The download is over> Run the game> Create an account to be able to enter the game> Account created > Open the game> G29 error game> Pain in the heart.psd> Start again> Now game has entered> Very happy.bat> Poorly optimized game> Hitting hard but still don't give up playing> Start the battle game mode royale> Falling from parachutes> Fell> Two steps> One shot from the fifths of the hells> Killed me> Hate.png> I open it again> Bug Bug One more bug I can enter air in game mode> Zombie appears out of nowhere> Killed me> Hate.
